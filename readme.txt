== Description ==

Why Use Video Chat Rooms? Adding a video chat room to your web site will increase the amount of time your users spend on your site, reading your content and consuming your advertising.  This plugin allows you to easily embed an ooVoo video chat room into your web site or blog which offers high quality video for up to 6 people at the same time. Talk face to face with your readers or customers, conduct focus groups, moderated conversations, allow your support staff to talk to buyers right from their web browser, etc.  Allow your Blogger or Social Network Groups to talk face-to-face with your community about any topic.

It is easy, just start by embedding this Video Chat Room Widget on your blog (scroll down to learn about this Widget). You can customize how it works or even build your own room widget for Wordpress.  If you want to record conversations or go to high resolution video, you will need to use the ooVoo client (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.oovoo.com/Developers.aspx">www.ooVoo.com/developer</a>).
